    <h3 class="clickable-javascript">JavaScript (JS)</h3>
    <p class="javascript-definition">an object-oriented computer programming language commonly used to create interactive effects within web browsers.</p>
    <h3>Operators</h3>
    <p>a symbol that is used to perform an operation. Most often these operations are arithmetic (addition, subtraction, etc)</p>
    <h3>Variables</h3>
    <p>Variables can be thought of as named containers. You can place data into these containers and then refer to the data simply by naming the container.</p>
    <h3>Variable naming conventions</h3>
    <p>Variables with multiple words should always use an underscore between words.</p>
    <h3>Functions</h3>
    <p>The function statement declares a function. A declared function is "saved for later use", and will be executed later, when it is invoked (called). In JavaScript, functions are objects, and they have both properties and methods. A function can also be defined using an expression</p>
    <h3>Methods</h3>
    <p>JavaScript methods are the actions that can be performed on objects. A JavaScript method is a property containing a function definition. Property.</p>
    <h3>Arguments</h3>
    <p>JavaScript functions have a built-in object called the arguments object. The argument object contains an array of the arguments used when the function was called (invoked).</p>
    <h3>Parameters</h3>
    <p>It is a local variable accessible within all functions and contains an entry for each argument passed to that function. The arguments object is an array-like construct which can be used to access arguments passed to the function even if a matching parameter isn't explicitly defined</p>
    <h3>Return</h3>
    <p>The return statement stops the execution of a function and returns a value from that function</p>
    <h3>Chaining methods</h3>
    <p>Method chaining is a technique that can be used to simplify code in scenarios that involve calling multiple functions on the same object consecutively. This is an example of how you can use method chaining when using jQuery.</p>
    <h3>Strings</h3>
    <p>tring literals (denoted by double or single quotes) and strings returned from String calls in a non-constructor context (i.e., without using the new keyword) are primitive strings. JavaScript automatically converts primitives to String objects, so that it's possible to use String object methods for primitive strings.</p>
    <h3>Booleans</h3>
    <p>The Boolean Object. Advertisements. The Boolean object represents two values, either "true" or "false". If value parameter is omitted or is 0, -0, null, false, NaN, undefined, or the empty string (""), the object has an initial value of false.</p>
    <h3>Undefined</h3>
    <p>null and undefined are both are used to represent the absence of some value. var a = null; a is initialized and defined</p>
    <h3>NaN</h3>
    <p>not a number</p>
    <h3>Escape</h3>
    <p>This function makes a string portable, so it can be transmitted across any network to any computer that supports ASCII characters.</p>
    <h3>Alert</h3>
    <p>The alert() method displays an alert box with a specified message and an OK button.</p>
    <h3>Comments</h3>
    <p>Any text between // and the end of the line will be ignored by JavaScript (will not be executed).</p>
    <h3>jQuery</h3>
    <p>jQuery is a concise and fast JavaScript library that can be used to simplify event handling, HTML document traversing, Ajax interactions and animation for speedy website development. </p>
    <h3>Attributes</h3>
    <p>Attributes provide additional information about an element</p>
